=========

A port of [this Fortran code]( http://personal.ph.surrey.ac.uk/~phs3ps/simple-hf.html ) in Python, with some nice visualisations thrown in.

There are some strange versions of l'HÃ´pital's rule and the numerical derivation rules used in the Fortran code, we're not entirely sure what the reasoning behind them was. We have implemented them here as well, but they could be wrong.
